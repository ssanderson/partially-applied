This page lists open source software that I've created or contributed to in a
significant way.

### [interface](https://github.com/quantopian/interface)

``interface`` is a Python library for defining interfaces and for verifying
that classes implement those interfaces. It aims to provide better error
messages and more strict semantics than Python's built-in ``abc`` module.

### [pgcontents](https://github.com/quantopian/pgcontents)

``pgcontents`` is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
extension library that replaces the Jupyter's default notebook storage system
with an alternative system that stores notebooks in
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

### [codetransformer](https://github.com/llllllllll/codetransformer)

``codetransformer`` is an experimental library for rewriting python bytecode at
runtime. I co-maintain codetransformer with [Joe Jevnik](https://github.com/llllllllll).

### [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline)

``zipline`` is a Python library for writing and testing automated trading
strategies. It forms the core of [Quantopian](www.quantopian.com)'s backtesting
and live trading platforms.
